Who Am I? 👀
======
I am Yusen Peng, a final year undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student at The Ohio State University (OSU), graduating in May 2026. 

During my time at OSU, I have maintained **4.00**/4.00 cumulative GPA and completed advanced AI courses including Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Data Mining. In addition, I am also graduating with **Honors Research Distinction**, where I was awarded with **Undergraduate Research Scholarship** this year based on my Honors Thesis proposal.

Research Interest 🧠
======

My primary research interests lie in **vision-language models**. I always investigate different approaches to
designing such models with the emphasis on the following three aspects:
1. **Capability**: design robust, generalizable vision-language models that are data-adaptive and task-versatile
2. **Efficiency**: engineer computational efficient vision-language models with good performance tradeoffs
3. **Interpretability**: develop transparent vision-language models that explain their decision-making process
