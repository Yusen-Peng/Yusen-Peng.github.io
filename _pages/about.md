Who Am I? 👀
======
I am Yusen Peng, a final year undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student at The Ohio State University (OSU), graduating in May 2026. 

During my time at OSU, I have maintained **4.00**/4.00 cumulative GPA and completed AI core courses including Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Data Mining.

More importantly, I am graduating with **Honors Research Distinction**, where I am investigating skeleton-based human action recognition as my undergraduate thesis. I was also awarded with Undergraduate Research Scholarship based on the thesis proposal in June 2025.

Outside of AI research, I often play basketball🏀, piano🎹, and guitar🎸! I enjoy K-pop too: NewJeans, Le Sserafim, and Illit are my favorites - but Hanni is my ultimate bias.

Research Interest 🧠
======
My current research primarily lies at the intersection of **vision** and **language** models. I always investigate different approaches to designing such models with more ***capability***, ***efficiency***, and ***interpretability***.
